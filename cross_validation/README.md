This module works on relatively smaller data sets where cross validation is used to evaluate the performance of DeepSEA feature representation on the given prediction task. 

# Model

DeepSEA feature representation with logistic regression head. SVM head is another choice but it involves more computation since hyperparameter is needed to be tuned. 

# Data size

~ 500,000 data points in at max. The limit needs to be tested.
