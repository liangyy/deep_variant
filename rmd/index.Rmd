# Data preparation

We need to incorporate new data (fetal brain related) to the model. It contains two sub tasks:

1. Annotate DeepSEA sequence with new labels. 
    - See pipeline memo [here](memo_preprocessing.html)
2. Extract new sequences of interest based on new data set. 
    - See pipeline memo [here](memo_extract.html)

# Train new models

There are three strategies:

0. Baseline classifier. [here](baseline.html)
1. Use DeepSEA sequences and DeepSEA feature representation. 
    - See results and analysis [here](type1.html). 
    - See performance on new sequences [here](type1_newseq.html)
    - See ROC/PR curve [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/liangyy/deep_variant/blob/code/pr_roc_curve/report/deepsea_vs_newseq_plot.html)
2. Use DeepSEA sequences but train a new model using the same architecture as DeepSEA. 
    - See results and analysis [here](type2.html). **ONGOING**
3. Include new sequences and train a new model using the same architecture. **TODO**

# Other analysis

There are some other directions and issues we need to explore and tackle. The analysis of them are listed here.

1. Examine which filter or a set of filters that contribute most to a particular prediction task. 
    - See details [here](motif_analysis.html). **ONGOING**
2. How to boost the model to specialize on a particular prediction task, say on certain tissue type? (change architecture? how to deal with overfitting?) **TODO**
3. How to measure the performance on imbalanced data. For instance, how to interpret ROC AUC and PR AUC?
    - See related discussion [here](auc.html)

# TODO list

* 4/9/17:
    1. ~~ROC/PR AUC interpretation~~ [link](auc.html)
    2. ~~Extract sequences from new data sets~~ [link](memo_extract.html)
* 4/10/17:
    3. New loss function? Weighted hinge loss? [link](loss_function.html) **TODO**
    4. Motif analysis of current model [link](motif_analysis.html) **ONGOING**
* 4/14/17:
    5. ~~Build up pipeline using snakemake.~~ See issue1 at [link](https://github.com/CreRecombinase/DeepVariantPrediction)
* 4/26/17:
    6. Build base line classifier
